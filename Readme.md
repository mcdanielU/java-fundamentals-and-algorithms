# Java Fundamentals Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Java Fundamentals Project**, a repository designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience in **Java programming**, covering essential concepts from **basic operations**, **data structures & algorithms**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **clean architecture**. Additionally, it contains examples to solve common **problem-solving** challenges, which helps in honing your coding skills for interviews and general problem-solving.

This project is structured to build a strong foundation in Java, focusing on improving both programming and problem-solving abilities.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

### 1. `Basics`
This section contains fundamental operations in Java. It is divided into:
- **Arithmetic**: Covers basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and factorial calculations.
- **Loops**: Examples of how to use different loop structures (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to iterate over data.
- **Method**: Demonstrates the use of Java methods, including parameter passing and return values.
- **StringClass**: Includes operations on strings, showcasing common string manipulation techniques.

Example:
- `Factorial.java`: Implements the factorial calculation using recursion.
- `variable.java`: Demonstrates variable declaration and usage in Java.

### 2. `CleanArchitecture`
This section provides an example of applying **Clean Architecture** principles to Java applications.
- **DijkstraGotoBadExample**: A demonstration of why using Goto statements or similar constructs can lead to unmanageable code and how Clean Architecture offers better solutions.

### 3. `DSandAlgorithms` (Data Structures and Algorithms)
This section provides implementations of common data structures and algorithms, focusing on improving computational efficiency.

- **DataStructures**:
   - **Arrays**: Demonstrates the implementation and manipulation of arrays in Java.
   - **Trees**: Covers basic tree structures like binary trees, providing a foundation for more complex tree algorithms.

### 4. `OOP` (Object-Oriented Programming)
This section focuses on examples that teach object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

- **ClassesAndObjects**: Demonstrates how to work with Java classes, objects, and object arrays.
   - `ArrayOfObjects.java`: Example of using arrays of objects to manage multiple instances of a class.
   - `Subject.java`: A basic class to demonstrate how objects can represent real-world entities and interact with one another.

### 5. `ProblemSolving`
This directory includes coding challenges and solutions that target algorithmic problem-solving, such as:
- Data structure problems (arrays, strings, trees).
- Algorithm challenges (sorting, searching, recursion).

Each solution is aimed at improving your ability to tackle real-world problems and includes:
- Problem statements
- Solutions in Java
- Time and space complexity analysis
